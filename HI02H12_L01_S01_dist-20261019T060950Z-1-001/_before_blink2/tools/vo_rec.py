"""The recorded voice-overs (2026-10-28, the user's `voiceovers/` folder, copied to vo_rec/) into the build. [vo-rec]

usage: python -I -X utf8 vo_rec.py [<dist folder>] [--retranscribe] [--gain <dB>]
  1. transcribes every wav with faster-whisper (small, Hindi, word timestamps; vo_rec/transcripts.json is the cache — delete it
     or pass --retranscribe to hear them again);
  2. re-containers every recording whose words are the page's into assets/Audio/<Audio ID>.ogg (Opus 48 kHz, like every clip
     here) — vo_stamp_sent4 is cut in two at the word boundary before "उनके" (the deck keeps the letter's last block as one line,
     the page plays it as rounds 4 and 5: vo_stamp_sent4 + vo_stamp_sent5);
  3. re-derives the word timings of every synced line (the *_assets/*.words.json files build.py reads) from the clip's own
     words: each shown word lined up with the heard word it is (a fuzzy, order-keeping match — whisper's spelling wobbles), the
     shown words it cannot hear (a bare mark, a word the clip says differently) spread over the gap between their neighbours;
  4. writes vo_rec/derived.json for build.py: the IDs applied (with the manifest's line as their text), the ones left out and
     why, the gate caption cue (the start of "चलिए" in vo_pt_tutorial), the split point.
Recordings whose words contradict the page are NOT applied (listed in derived.json "skipped"): the story recordings tell a
different story (1-4.wav, vo_story_s1, vo_story_r1), G1's sentence and hint 3 say "राजू" where the frame says "पिंकी".

[vo-rec2] (2026-11-05) the user's SECOND batch: the 74 lines of the regenerated VO manifest (every clip the build plays), each named
by its Audio ID, copied over the first batch's files in vo_rec/ (the first batch is kept in ../_before_vo_rec2/vo_rec/). The story's
beats, the two contrast sentences, the moral and the letter's last block now come as their OWN files (vo_story_b1..b4, c1, c2,
moral, vo_stamp_sent5), so 1-4.wav / vo_story_s1.wav are out of vo_rec/ and RENAME / TRIM / the sent4 split are idle (kept for a
combined take). G1's sentence and the recap examples are the pages' words now (no SKIP). New: T2's explanation and G1's sentence are
synced lines; the gate lines (vo_pt_*) and the celebration's vo_well_done are recordings too — derived.json carries their caption
cues (the speech onset of the headline's words) and the celebration's beak bits (the [dun-chrome] detector: RMS per 25 ms, open
above half the local max over +-12 frames and within 18 dB of the peak — it reproduces dun_assets/cel_bits.json bit for bit); and
the cues the pages time on their clips: L1's "दादाजी" + its speech end, L2's "ठप्पा" + the instruction's length. Two sync fixes in the
alignment: every said word starts where its sound does (whisper puts starts inside the pause before a word — the first word at 0.00
over the takes' ~0.27 s of room tone; 305 of 923 starts moved, up to 0.65 s), and said words left on one start (a joined word) share
the span to the next word by their letters. vo_g1_intro.wav of the second batch
is a different line ("वाह! क्या बात है!"): not copied, the first batch's take stays (KEPT_FIRST).

[vo-rec3] (2026-11-10) the user's THIRD batch (voiceovers_batch (32).zip): 70 of the 79 lines of the deck-first VO manifest (2026-11-09) —
every line but the nine option read-outs of G4 / P1 / P2 (their second-batch takes stay) — copied over vo_rec/ with cp -p. New IDs
the build had no take of: vo_build_hint3 (G1-G3's hint 3, said with the hand), vo_g4_hint2, vo_p1_hint1 / hint2, vo_p2_hint1 / hint2
(the sentence picks' own hints), vo_stamp3_intro (L2 round 3's line). The zip carries two LATER re-takes added at its end with a stray
space in the name ("vo_stamp3_intro .wav" 10:59, its copy "vo_stamp3_intro  (1).wav", "vo_stamp3_hint2 .wav" 11:03, the batch's own
files 05:34): those are the takes copied as vo_stamp3_intro.wav / vo_stamp3_hint2.wav. vo_g1_intro says its line now (KEPT_FIRST empty).
Heard: every file says its manifest line except two spoken-only lines that say "प्रश्न" for "सवाल" (vo_demo2_explain, vo_recap_prashn_when;
heard so with and without the script as whisper's prompt) and two small ones (vo_g1_intro adds "और", vo_stamp1_hint3 drops "एक"):
SPOKEN keeps what is said. T3's / T4's explanation cues (the "?" / "," tile lights) are read here now, by onset() on the LAST
"प्रश्न…" / "अल्प…" word (whisper writes "प्रश्न वाचक" as two words in this take), instead of build.py's whisper start."""
